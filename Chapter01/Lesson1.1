ยง1.1 - The Pythagorean Theorem


In this lesson, we discuss the Pythagorean equation, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. We also talk about the distance formula, which gives the distance between two points in a plane, and how it can be derived from the Pythagorean equation. The midpoint formula is introduced, which gives the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment. Additionally, we explored how the Pythagorean equation relates to circles, particular how the distance formula can be used to find the equation of a circle given its center and radius. Overall, these formulas and concepts are fundamental in geometry. This lesson will take about 90 minutes to complete.
